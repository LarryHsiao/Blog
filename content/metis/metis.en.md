Do you wish that each small adventure in life doesn't become a hard-to-organize album as time goes by? Is a diary just a piece of text that's hard to empathize with?

Metis is here to help you organize your adventure journey.

It is a diary, where you can record your current state of mind with words; it is a photo album, capturing your current mood through photos; it is also a map, with every moment of your life leaving traces on this map.
