I would like to thank everyone who has supported the theme by using, starring and recommending it.</p><h2><a href="/2016/09/19/hagura.html">What is Hagura?</a></h2><p>Hagura is a Kannada word for light-weight. The theme is very light and has very little CSS. The theme has very legible font style and distraction free layout.</p><h2><a href="/jekyll/update/2016/09/18/welcome-to-jekyll.html">Welcome to Jekyll!</a></h2><p>You’ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p><h2><a href="/2016/09/17/all-text.html">A sample post</a></h2><p>Truly it was a great journey, and in it I met with many, whom to know was to love; but whom never could I see again; for life has not space enough; and each must do his duty to the security and well-being of the Redoubt. Yet, for all that I have set down, we travelled much, always; but there were so many millions, and so few years.</p><h2><a href="/2016/05/07/elements.html">HTML elements</a></h2><p>Header 1</p><h2><a href="/2016/05/07/documentation.html">Documentation</a></h2><p>Features: Hagura is a theme made for blogs with long text paragraphs. Made to be easy on eyes as well.</p></div></article></main><footer><div class="links"> <a href="/about/">About</a> <a href="/contact/">Contact</a> <a class="theme" onclick="theme()">Dark/Light</a></div><p class="copy"><small>Copyrights by | Developed by <a href="http://webjeda.com">webjeda</a></small></p></footer><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ga-lite@1/dist/ga-lite.min.js" async></script><script> var galite = galite || {}; galite.UA = 'UA-83979019-1';</script></body></html>
